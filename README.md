Input:
Within the HelloWorld mobile application the user does not need to provide changing data inputs. The source code implements data through React Native Text components where it contains the hard-coded values including name, degree program, and school name. Every execution of the app displays consistent data due to its static content format.

Process:
The HelloWorld mobile application was developed by utilizing React Native together with Expo as its processing platform. The application combines View components for layout organization with three Text components to present its necessary content. The style application occurs through the implementation of StyleSheet. A yellow color defines the background of the main View in accordance with user specifications. A combination of Flexbox items alignItems and justifyContent positions the content while the application utilizes font sizes with specified margins for clear reading.

Output:
The application generates a mobile screen containing yellow-colored text that centers three information lines showing both user data and academic details. The interface follows a clean setup that fulfills all required specifications for users and systems.
